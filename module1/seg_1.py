# Wednesday March 13, 2019. This is the first time I've ever seen this happen and I'm not quite sure why it occured 
# I was on Python Tutor, we deleted  the original code which is scattred as if it was passed through many loops
# and recreated in other way. I'll include the original segment  and start tearing into this thing.
# this may just be the start of something. I'm not sure what to think yet. It self replicated into randomness. I'm facinated by this thing.
# I don'tw ant to be able to access an element in this 2d array and insert a value

'I got rid of most of the print(a) fintions as those are useless. There is definitely a lot of redundency and it seems realy crazy. I count at least 30+ for loops. Well, we shall see, what will be '
